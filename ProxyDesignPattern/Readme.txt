The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern used in object-oriented programming. It provides a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

âœ… Definition:
A Proxy is a class that functions as an interface to something else. The proxy could be controlling access, managing resource usage, or adding functionality like logging, lazy loading, or security checks.

ðŸ”§ Use Case Scenarios:
Virtual Proxy â€“ Lazy loading of heavyweight objects.

Protection Proxy â€“ Access control (authorization).

Remote Proxy â€“ Representing an object in a different address space (e.g., client-server).

Smart Proxy â€“ Adds extra logic (like caching, logging, reference counting) when accessing the real object.

It is used in caching data , providing access restrictions and many more uses..
