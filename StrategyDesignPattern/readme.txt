in this pattern without using strategy design pattern , we are seeing duplicacy of code which is not good 
for big and complex applications, 
so we use this pattern to avoid duplicacy and increase reusability of code using interfaces

Usually in this pattern we observe that the siblings of parent's child class are implementing same logic
or same code (increasing duplicacy) so we can use this design pattern here.
